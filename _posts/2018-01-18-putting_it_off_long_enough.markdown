I first learned about coding back in middle school, where I was completely fascinated with the idea of building and creating things using a variety of cryptic languages. My fascination dwindled over the years until sophomore year in High School where I decided to take a couple HTML courses. This reignited the interest I had in code, however once these two rather simple courses finished up, I started to forget about coding all together. Instead I started to pursue business with my focus on a degree and career in marketing in the future.


A few years go by, where I am constantly reminded of the unbelievable growth in the developer field and how there are never enough people to fill the jobs that are needed. Pepper in the occasional research I would do myself in regard to career outlooks for marketers and developers and I finally decided something needed to change. At this point however, I was already enrolled at Penn State and well on my way to completing my bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Management and Marketing. So, in my senior year I decided rather than going and getting a job and learning to code sporadically throughout the next few years, I would start my coding journey immediately following graduation.


I looked in to a variety of options that would kick start my coding journey and ultimately decided on Flatiron School’s online full stack web developer program, which I could not be happier about. Though I may have been able to save a few months or year by simply realizing my goals earlier and going to school to achieve a computer science degree, I believe my unique situation will lend me greater opportunities into the future. I hope that one day I will be able to combine my two specialties and start a business of my own where I help other small businesses with their web development needs.


I put it off long enough and I am ready to get started!
