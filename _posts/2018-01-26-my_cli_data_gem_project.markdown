Having now completed the CLI Data Gem Project, I feel as if a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Though this particular project was fairly straight forward and simple, I seemed to make it as hard for myself as I possibly could. In the end though after week of hard work, I believe I ended up with a pretty nifty CLI program that allows the user to fetch a list of now playing movies from IMDB and then depending on their input it will provide a link to the site for that specific movie.

I originally planned for the program to scrape the summary and actor information and provide that to the user, but after a few days of spinning my own wheels I decided to keep it simple. I ended up changing the actual purpose of my program several times. With each iteration being shaped by what the code I had written was providing me.

I will be honest, I was very confident I fully understood Nokogiri before starting this project, but it is now evident to me that I need a bit more practice before I feel one hundred percent confident with it. I particularly struggled with getting specific pieces of scraped data to appear, often times with the result either showing the entire pages scraped data or none at all.

In the end though I kind of conceded to my code, as one of my final iterations of my program I wanted to scrape a list of movies and then have a user select a movie and be provided with the director of that movie. However, through my struggle with Nokogiri, the data that was actually returned was links to all the movies. So, rather than spending more time getting nowhere, I decided to edit the prompts of my program to fit the end result. Five days later and I now have a completed and more importantly, working CLI program.

If you would like to take a look at my CLI program I will provide a link to it below:
