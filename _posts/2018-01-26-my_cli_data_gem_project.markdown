Having now completed the CLI Data Gem Project, I feel as if a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Though this particular project was fairly straight forward and simple, I seemed to make it as hard for myself as I possibly could. In the end though after more than a week of hard work, I believe I ended up with a pretty nifty CLI program that allows the user to fetch some now playing movies from IMDB and then depending on their input it will provide a the summary and director for that specific movie.

I ended up changing the actual purpose of my program several times. With each iteration being shaped by what the code I had written was providing me. I will be honest, I was very confident I fully understood Nokogiri before starting this project, but it is now evident to me that I need a bit more practice before I feel one hundred percent confident with it. I particularly struggled with getting specific pieces of scraped data to appear, often times with the result either showing the entire pages scraped data or none at all.

Toward the end of the project I started to conceded to my code, as one of the final iterations of my program I wanted to scrape a list of movies and then have a user select a movie and be provided with the director of that movie. However, through my struggle with Nokogiri, the data that was actually returned was links to all the movies. So, rather than spending more time getting nowhere, I decided to edit the prompts of my program to fit the end result. Five days later and I now have a completed and more importantly, working CLI program.

**EDIT:** Frustrated that I let the code get the best of be, I was determined to go back and get my first iteration working the way I had inteded it to. Low and behold after a few hours of deliberation and testing new pieces of code, I have finally got the code to work the way I wanted to two weeks ago. I have updated the YouTube video walkthrough and link below.

If you would like to take a look at my CLI program I will provide a link to it below:
