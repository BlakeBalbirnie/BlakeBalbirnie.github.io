One of the most underrated tools for any developer and in turn businesses would without a doubt have to be SQL and the databases it is able to create. Whether you as the programmer choose to use MySQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL, or another one of the many open source SQL database management systems, you know the power of this simple yet sophisticated language. I'll be honest, I was quite nervous when I started to first learn about SQL, as I am when I first start on any new programming language. However, those butterflies quickly dissipated as it became clear to me just how simple SQL was and how fluid the process of interacting with databases was as well.

I still remember saying to myself how reminiscent it was to Excel spreadsheets. It's like a programming language written to interact with Excel itself, expect the databases you are creating, editing, and grabbing data from are completely independent from any other program. After a few hours I found the entire process quite enjoyable, but that is mainly due to me being a spreadsheet nerd. I love playing around with numbers and data in spreadsheets, something many would not be proud to say. 

After I finished up with the SQL labs and lesson on Flatiron School, I moved on to Active Records and ORMs, which were much more difficult than I anticipated given that I found SQL to be so easy. I will be going back through these two lessons a few times to make sure I fully comprehend the ins and outs of them. 

In writing this blog post, I decided I would go do some more in-depth research on SQL and I was amazed to see that according to Indeed in 2016, there were more SQL programming jobs than any other language. That now brings me to the importance of SQL to businesses. Almost every single industry and field of business has the need for databases. Whether they are used for client login information, financial data, stats for sports and more, or specs for cars and beyond. The breath of ability of databases is almost limitless. It is where all of our information and data is stored. 

To put it simply, SQL and databases have the ability and indeed do store our life's information as a whole.
